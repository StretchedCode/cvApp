# CV Creator application
So, creating this application was really enjoyable. Seeing how powerful React was as a front end framework was really interesting, and sped up the development
process extremely quickly. 

For example, if I were to use vanilla Javascript, I would have to `scaffold` the design of the page within a test.html file in order to see how the project would
hold up visually, and then follow that design template by creating all of the necessary elements within a JS file. With React and the introduction of JSX however, I can simply run npm start, and write all of the JSX that I needed within the render function of the class component, viewing the updates in real time!
